### All examples will use the Nancy Framework

#### Authorization - Getting user authorization url
```
Get["api/oauth/authorize", true] = async (nothing, ct) => 
{
   var url = await authenticator.UserRequstUrl(requestToken).ConfigureAwait(true);
   new JsonRespons(url, new DefaultJsonSerializer());
